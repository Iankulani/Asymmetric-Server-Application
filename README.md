# Asymmetric-Server-Application

A complex asymmetric server application. This project demonstrates an asymmetric server-client architecture where the server plays a more complex role in handling communications, encryption, and processing, while the client is responsible for sending requests and displaying results. The server utilizes asymmetric encryption (public/private key pairs) to ensure secure data transmission between the client and the server.
